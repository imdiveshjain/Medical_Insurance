# Medical_Insurance

Overview
This project focuses on predicting medical insurance costs using machine learning algorithms. The predictive model is built and trained using a dataset containing information about individuals' attributes, such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region. Various machine learning techniques are explored to develop an accurate model for predicting medical insurance costs.

Project Description
Predicting medical insurance costs is crucial for insurance companies and individuals alike. In this project, machine learning algorithms are employed to analyze individual characteristics and predict their medical insurance costs. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook for transparency and ease of reproduction.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes attributes such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. The dataset is preprocessed within the Jupyter Notebook to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and extract relevant features for the machine learning model.

Dependencies
